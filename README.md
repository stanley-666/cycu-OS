# Target
learning cpu scheduling, theads, paging, sorting algorithms

## homework1:
Parallelizing sorting algorithms and divide input sizes uses threads and processes and see the performance differences.
## homework2:
Understand FIFO, RR, SRTF, PPRR, HRRN and see the differences by arrival time, ID, waiting time, turnaround time.
## homework3:
Understand FIFO, LRU, LFU used LRU, MFU-FIFO, MFU-LRU replacement stategies and then count page fault, page replaces time with fixed page frames.
